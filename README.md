# Using the python package, `niceday_client`
For development purposes, you can install this python package using pip, from the repo root directory:
```
pip install .
```

Alternatively, if you just want to use it (e.g. in a Dockerfile) then add it to your requirements.txt using the most updated version:
```
git+https://github.com/PerfectFit-project/niceday_client#v0.1.0
```

# New versions release
When a new version of the niceday_client package is ready and tested, a [new relase has to be created together with release notes] (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository). The release name has to follow the semantic versioning convention.
